JumpJump
========

This is a sample game for the [HappyFunTimes party games system](http://greggman.github.io/HappyFunTimes).

I'm in the process of making the games individually installable so that other people can easily add
games to the system. This is the first one so expect lots of churn.

Cloning
-------

Prerequisites

*   node.js http://nodejs.org

If you clone this you'll need to do at least 2 things

2.  Make a symbolic link from this folder to the happyFunTimes games folder

    ls -s ./ path/to/happyFunTimes/games/jumpjump
